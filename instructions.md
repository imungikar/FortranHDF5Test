Building the Repository on Stellar Cluster




Committing Changes Through VS Code
- go to source control (which looks like branches)
- Click the upper left check mark, but make sure to hit on commit and push
- enter your commit message on the first thing, and then click the check mark in the upper-right side of the screen



Project Goals
- .bin and .dat --> just clean up
- checkpoints and snapshots --> fix for efficiency
- get rid of MPI barriers, optimize the parallel processing
- (worth learning all the Git features from the command line later)
- On resume talk about how this is software is used by various companies, optimizes code by x%
